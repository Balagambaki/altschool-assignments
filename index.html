<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

<h3>Information Abou Me</h3>
<P>I am by name Bala Muhammad Gambaki, from Azare, Katagum Local Government of Bauchi State. I base in the state capital, and I work as a Public Health Officer. <br><br>
I am a student at AltSchool Africa in the School of Engineering, Frontend Engineering Track with the student ID ALT/SOE//025/3537. <br><br>
My journey in the Frontend Engineering stated 2024 in Kano State, where I was a beneficiary of a Tech program, the program admitted students into 3 programs (Frontend Development, UI/UX Design, and Data Science and Machine Learning). I applied for Data Science and Machine Learning and I was offered admission to study Frontend Development, I started to make my research on what is all Frontend Development about, as a person with little background in Tech then I only have skills in Graphics Design as I came from Public Health background. To cut the story short I ended my program for the duration of six months with one month internship as planned(we didn't had the Internship as planned), and the program was structured in way that a newbie in the field can learn easily, combined with our tutor wasn't familiar with the basics that we need to know, somethings are new to him also, he learn in the process and it turns out I and my colleagues teaches ourselves what we learn, that was how it ended. <br><br>
I have been hearing about AltSchool Africa, but I don't care once to research more on it, as I thought all this online school are scam, one cannot have the guidance, mentorship, learn or acquire the relevant skills and knowledge needed. My journey in AltSchool started through my application for the Bala Wunti Tech Fellowship Pragram, I applied not knowing I will be enrolled in AltSchool Africa for my studies, I came to know about it after I was selected for the Fellowship. I was like will this really work, would I have the skills, knowledge and expertise I need in my journey to pursue a career in tech space. <br><br>
I became rest assured after I started to interact with the AltSchool Africa portal, the LMS, how the members in school care, guide and reach out on every important information, I then realised I am at the right place at the right time. <br><br>
I am confident by the end of my studies and training at AltSchool Africa I will be a skilled Frontend Engineer. Thank you
